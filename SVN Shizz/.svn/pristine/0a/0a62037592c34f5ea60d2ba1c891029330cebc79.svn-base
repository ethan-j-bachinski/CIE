 * Programmers: Ethan Bachinski & Eric Mensen
 * Name: hw4.c
 * Description: For this group assignment we had to implement a code that helped the robot go around a maze and keeping track of
 * the addresses that it visits by adding them to a linked list.
 * *****************************************Part 1*******************************************************************************
 * The robot will learn the maze by following the left hand on wall rule.  When the robot makes a left turn or right turn it will
 * be recorded in a linked list and when it comes to a uturn.
 * To get the robot to follow the maze and properly store the turns and addresses we implemented several functions.  The first
 * one is appendTurnToEnd which assigned a value to a given turn and added it to the end of the linked list.  We next wrote the
 * function freeAllMemoryInTurnList that freed all the memory in out linked list.  After that we wrote the function lengthTurnList
 * that records the uturns that the robot makes and stores them as addresses, this also returns the pointers of the nodes that
 * correspond to that address. Next we wrote the function concatenateTurnArrays which took the end of one linked list and linked
 * it to the start of another linked list.
 * ****************************************Part 2********************************************************************************
 * After our robot has learned to traverse the maze, stores the addresses and turns in a linked list and then returns back to the
 * dispatch station it will ask the user to choose from a list of addresses that the user wants the robot to deliver to between
 * 0 and the max number of addresses that the robot has found. The robot will then go to only the addresses that have been
 * selected, skipping over any that have not been chosen to be delivered to.  In order for our robot to do that we had to implement
 * the copyAndSimplifyTurnList function that took a segment of the linked list and removed the portions that were addresses that
 * were not specified to be visited.  We then wrote the function giveOptimizedTurnList that created an optimized path from the
 * linked list of our original path.  This function uses our getAddressLocations function, gets the input for the addresses for
 * which to be delivered, and then simplifies the path to create the final optimized linked list.
 * ***************************************Part 3*********************************************************************************
 * Once the user has entered the addresses that they want the robot to deliver to the robot will then take the optimized path that
 * was created from the giveOptimizedTurnList function and
